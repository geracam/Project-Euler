# Project Euler

## Overview

The solutions to the project euler project written in java.


## Technologies Used 

**1.** Java

## Prerequisites

1. [Projec Euler] (<https://projecteuler.net/about>), a true challenge.


## The Questions

######These are the questions solved so far:

1.  Problem 1: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 233/
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

2.  Problem 2: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
